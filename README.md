# PellissippiStateCareerServices
A capstone of my work with Pellissippi State Community College's Career Services - Data Organization, Analysis, and Presentation

For over two years, I worked with the Career Services department at Pellissippi State Community College to streamline data related operations in a manner that would offer resources supportive to the department and college's goals of improved student engagement and employment outcomes.

The bulk of this work took form in an Access database integrating graduate employment outcomes, employer contacts, event participation, job postings and referrals, daily office metrics, and the workflow forms and reporting queries and reports related. Functions were grouped in a graphical interface with in-context links to detailed and visual training materials. A couple before-after examples are highlighted in slides 8 and 9 of the attached "Kevin Deike's Career Services Analytics Presentation.pptx."

With the data surrounding student employment outcomes structured around degrees and certificates awarded, rather than simply the students by themselves, exporting for relevant exploratory data analysis in Microsoft Power BI was a relatively simple process. The potential uses and ramifications of student employment outcomes both in Career Services and throughout the college are further explored in the attached PowerPoint presented at [https://blogs.pstcc.edu/video/2019/07/29/kevtalk/](https://blogs.pstcc.edu/video/2019/07/29/kevtalk/).

The following are time codes of the different topics covered with the presentation:
Start - Larger scope discussion of how data from Career Services departments across the country are contributing to the next steps of College development
7:53 – Internal Career Services Database Improvements
11:18 – Placement Percentages – Static Word Document Before and Interactive Power BI Dashbaord After
17:19 – All Outcomes Proof of Concept exploration
19:28 – All Outcomes linked with Achieving the Dream Demographics Proof of Concept exploration
26:34 – Q & A

While the college will be using and updating the tools I created, the versions of the public dashboards I created and used with the presentation are preserved for reference with this repository.
